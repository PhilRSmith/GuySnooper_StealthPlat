# GUY SNOOPER: A 2.5D Stealth Platformer
The intention of this project is to develop a fully functioning 2.5D platformer of my own vision. This is entirely for fun, and mostly for my own learning of what makes the unity engine tick.

Update 09/06/2020: I've decided to pivot the style from sly cooper to possibly castlevania, but I still want to see if I can incorporate stealth mechanics like pick pocketing and the like.

## Milestone Goals:

- August: Basic; good feeling player movement.
- September: Basic; Level structure for one level by the end of September.
- October: Basic; Enemies and behavior by the end of October.
- November: Basic; Player mechanics such as pick-pocketing.
- December: Basic; Prototype full level.
